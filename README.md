[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1--alpha-orange)](https://popnetwork.github.io/popnetwork-masternode/releases/popnetwork-masternode_20191201.zip) [![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-win--32-lightgrey)](https://popnetwork.github.io/popnetwork-masternode/releases/popnetwork-masternode_20191201.zip) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)]() 

POP Network is an ecosystem of blockchain and artificial intelligence applications built to power the streaming economy. Components include:
- **Masternode Torrent Network** for decentralized, peer-to-peer streaming
- **Superdelegated Proof-of-Stake** blockchain for ultra-fast transaction processing
- **Artificial Intelligence** content protection to defend the network from harmful material

**POP Network Masternodes** form a decentralized, peer-to-peer torrent network to store and stream all media on POP Network. Masternodes earn 35% of all POP Network block rewards for performing this critical service.

### Release Notes
- This is Windows-only testnet software and should be treated as extremely experimental.
- Do not upload any mission critical content to testnet. There is no guarantee future versions of the Masternode will be backwards-compatible.
- It is not possible to earn POP Network Tokens (POP) for operating a Masternode on testnet.
- The purpose of this release is to demonstrate how easy operating a POP Masternode can be and thus demonstrate how easy it would be to earn crypto on the torrent network.

# Install
- [Download the latest version](https://popnetwork.github.io/popnetwork-masternode/releases/popnetwork-masternode_20191201.zip) of POP Network Masternode
- Unzip installer and run `popnetwork-masternode.exe`
- ✨Automagically ✨start streaming the POP Network Demo video as seen the [POP Network website](https://thepopnetwork.org/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=pages#demo). On mainnet your Masternode would earn POP for streaming content.
- Use `FILE > CREATE` to start seeding your own content to the network
